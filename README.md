### 👋 Hi there  !

I am a final-year student majoring in AI 🤓 I am fascinated by the different domains of AI 💻🧠. As I delve deeper into AI, I find myself gaining a better understanding of humans🧑‍🦱, as AI is inspired by our own capabilities💪. I love the fact that specializing in AI does not limit my knowledge to only this field; instead, AI's applications extend to 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 ! 💊🤖💰🏭...<br />
I like to organize my things 🤓 and have a vision about the future 👁️, whether it's my bedtime or my next professional step 🙂.
